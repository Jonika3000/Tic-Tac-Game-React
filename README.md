At startup, there will be authorization. First you need to register 2 accounts (yours and your friend) then login.

Next we will see the playing field, the fields of the players and also the rating. In the fields of the players,
you need to enter the logins that were used during registration. The first player will play as a cross.
After someone wins or you just need to clear the field, you need to press the button "start over" and the winner will be counted 
a point to his rating
